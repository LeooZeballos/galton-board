# Galton Board Simulation

A visually stunning and interactive simulation of the **Galton Board** (also known as the Bean Machine) built with HTML5 Canvas and modern JavaScript. This project demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem and probability distributions in real-time.

## Features

- **Physics-based Simulation**: Realistic ball collisions, gravity, and bounce physics.
- **Multiple Distributions**:
  - Normal (Bell Curve)
  - Skewed Left / Right
  - Bimodal
  - Uniform
- **Dynamic Theming**: Choose from a variety of themes including Neon, Cyberpunk, Nature, and Football Clubs.
- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Adjust simulation speed (up to x100).
  - Modify the number of peg rows (6 to 15).
  - Pause and Resume functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: Main entry point containing the UI structure.
- **`script.js`**: Core logic for the physics engine, rendering loop, and event handling.
- **`themes.js`**: Configuration file containing color palettes and theme definitions.
- **`style.css`**: Styling for the UI, featuring a modern glassmorphism aesthetic.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Use the control panel to:
   - Select a distribution pattern.
   - Change the visual theme.
   - Adjust the drop speed.
   - Add or remove rows to see how it affects the distribution.
